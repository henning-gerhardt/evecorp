## Background

Why not develop something in two things which makes fun? Typo3 extension development on one side and playing EvE on the other?

Started as basic example of Typo3 extension development on version 6.0 (how its works in general and what changed since version 4.2) and searching of current market data from Jita 4-4, the idea was born to merge this two things together. After first presentation inside my corporation some suggestions (f.e. showing / hiding prices based on corporation tax) were made and later implemented. Other suggestions came through development and using earlier versions like caching of market data to reduce calling third party sites.
